Welcome to the local_movies GEM created as a portfolio project for Flatiron School. The purpose of this GEM is to take in a user's zipcode, and then display local movies playing in theatres in their area. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'local_movies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install local_movies

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
